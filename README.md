Nutyper is an R-Shiny based web application that enables interactive data management, anlysis and reporting of MALDI-TOF spectra generated from PCR amplificated DNA/RNA fragments. 
Nutyper is developped on top of MALDI-TOF based Single Nucleotide Polymorphism detection toolkit [maldiSNP](https://github.com/wtbxsjy/maldiSNP)
